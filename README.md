# Dejan Skorupan LeyLine Assignment

## ✏️ Project Description

This technical challenge involves implementing a settlement process between two parties, Party A and Party B. The system should handle iterative negotiation of settlement amounts by Party A, along with approvals or objections from Party B. The process should ensure that all changes and responses are reflected on Party A's and Party B's interface.

To test the app I suggest you run the start script and then open up 2 browser windows both on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Choose Party A on one window and Party B on another one and place them side by side.

## 💻 Development Environment

This project was developed with the following environment:

- **Node** v21.7.3
- **npm** v10.5.0

## 📄 Available Scripts

To start the app run:

#### `npm run start-app`

This will start both the app and the server in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
